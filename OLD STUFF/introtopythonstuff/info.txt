Decided to relearn the basics from the Introduction to Programming in Python
textbook by Robert Sedgewick, Kevin Wayne, and Robert Dondero.

I'm just going to follow through the textbook and do the activities at the end
of each section. Unfortunately I don't have the solutions to the problems so I
will just be guessing whether or not I am writing proper code and doing stuff
correctly.
